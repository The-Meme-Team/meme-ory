        Welcome to our matching game hosting several dank memes! Ready to play? Skip down to the name entry below and start from there! If you don't know, don't worry. Give me a second and I will explain everything.
      </p>

      <p class="game-info size-16 text-center text-dark center">
        We will present you with a board of 16 cards arranged in a 4x4 pattern. You will click two of the cards to compare the images on the other side. If they match, the images will remain flipped and you will carry on. If they items don't match, the cards will flip back over and you will have to select two new cards.
      </p>

      <p class="game-info size-16 text-center text-dark center">
        Once all 8 pairs are matched, the game will be over and you will be presented with the number of tries it took you to guess all 8 correctly. Sound good? Perfect. Enter your usename below and let's get started!
