          <p class="right text-dark">A massive nerd, Austin spends most of his time in a dark room alone in front of a computer. His free time is spent most often playing games of all sorts, including JRPGs, FPS's, and strategy games. Though he is fairly lucky in real life, his gaming life is plagued with bad luck, every battle constantly plagued with rogue critical hits or random failures.Proving the old saying true, Austin's gaming is often the key example of "Doing everything perfectly and still failing."He is also very much aware of the fact that he is over-weight, thank you very much.</p>

          <p class="left text-dark">Major K-POP lover, especially Big Bang, Christina likes to explore Seattle and find good places to eat. She also thinks that dogs are better than cats by far because cats are weird and kind of selfish. She is very particular but she usually has a logical reason why. She was previously working in real estate before joining Codefellows and is excited to not deal with unrealistic people anymore. "Come say hi to me because I like meeting new interesting people!"</p>

David likes to fish, camp and hike, and feels like living in Washington State almost makes loving those activities mandatory! He is super happy to be advancing his career here at Code Fellows, and plans on continuing in the test discipline, as an SDET for at least a few years before moving to dev. </p>
