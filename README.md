# Stories

 - I am a player and I want to be presented with a text entry field for typing in my name.
 - I am a player and I want to be able to record my user name so I can associate my scores with my name if I access my scores later.
 - I am a player and I want to be presented with a submit button labeled "Start Game" so I understand that entering my user name is the way I start playing.
 - I am a player and I want to be presented with the game board, immediately after clicking on the "Start Game" button so there are no extra steps needed.
 - I am a player and I would like to have simple instructions visible above the game, so I know how to play.
 - I am a player and I would like to be presented with a game board on the game page above the fold.
 - I am a player and I would like the game board to be a 4x4, evenly spaced grid of images, centered on the page, above the fold, so I am drawn to look at the game board.
 - I am a player and I would like the images to be placed in a random order, so the game is a unique each time I play.
 - I am player and I would like the grid of images to remain static, until the game is <emp>over</emp> <!-- needs clarification, when is the game "over?" -->
 - I am a player and I would like the images to be hidden until I click on one, then I want it to be revealed.
 - I am a player and I would like the first image to remain visible until I click on a second image so I know what I am trying to match the second image to.
 - I am a player and I would like the game to allow me to click on a second image to reveal it.
 - I am a player and I would like both images revealed, until the *end of the game* so I know I have successfully made a match.
 -or-
 - I am a player and I would like both images to be re-hidden 'turned over', after 5 seconds, if they do not match.
 - I am a player and I would like the game to end after I match all 16 images.
